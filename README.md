# Don't drop the ball


## The method

Don't Drop The Ball (DDTB) is an easy, high level, way to track tasks. It aims to solve the problem of always knowing who is responsible for what. Basically, a task is represented as a ball. Once you pick up a ball, you cannot drop it. The only way to get rid of a ball is to either pass it to someone else, or make a goal (finish the task).

### What DDTB is *not*

DDTB is not a planning / time tracking tool or method. There are plenty of tools and methods solving this problem already.

## The application

A fun representation of DDTB visualized as a soccer field with players and balls. The application is open source, and I encourage you to clone it and modify it to your own liking. Any and all PRs are more than welcome.
